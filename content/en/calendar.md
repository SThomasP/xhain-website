Many of our events are open community events that are held at our place. You can also rent xHain as a meeting venue or space for (closed) events. If you're planning a workshop, looking for a more unconventional meeting space, want to screen your film or advance your fan fiction in a creative environment, ask us and we'll work out the details together.
